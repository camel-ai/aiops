## ‚ú® what's aiops?

Simply put, it's about empowering multi-cloud deployment and operations with AI intelligence!<br>
„ÉªYou can query and deploy cloud resources (AWS, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Azure, etc., all covered!) by talking to a chatbot.<br>
„ÉªYou state your requirements, and AI automatically helps you design cloud architecture and generate deployment scripts (Terraform code so easy!).<br>
„ÉªEven, you provide a hand-drawn architecture diagram or document, and it can turn it into reality!<br>
„ÉªDeployment issues? AIOps can also intelligently repair and self-heal!<br>
„ÉªDeep integration with the Terraform MCP server<br>
„Éªai auto IAC coding recall rate exceeds 90%<br>
„ÉªgptDiagram all your envisioned cloud architectures.<br>
Sounds futuristic, doesn't it? AIOps project is dedicated to building the next-generation multi-cloud AI deployment and executable DevOps assistant!<br>
